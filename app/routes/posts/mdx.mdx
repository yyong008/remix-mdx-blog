# Markdown for the component era

[MDX][website] is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in
your markdown documents.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them
within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.
🚀

```md
import {Chart} from './snowfall.js'
export const year = 2018

# Last year’s snowfall

In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
It was followed by a warm spring which caused
flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

<Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
```

See [§ What is MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) for more info on the
format.
See [§ Playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground/) to try it out.

## What is this?

This GitHub repository contains several packages for compiling the MDX format to
JavaScript, integrating with bundlers such as webpack and Rollup, and for using
it with frameworks such as React, Preact, and Vue.

See [§ Getting started](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/) for how to
integrate MDX into your project.
